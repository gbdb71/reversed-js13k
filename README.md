# Reversed
**Reversed**: a varying-gravitational platforming puzzle, written for js13kGames–2015

## Compatibility

Browser support is actually pretty decent: the game should work in any modern browser, even Internet Explorer (≥ 10).

For best results, however, it's advised to use either Firefox or Chrome.

On mobile, both Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android) are supported. Safari is much better.

ASCII art is problematic on Android. While not game-breaking, it's implemented differently and looks slightly worse.

The game is better suited for landscape mode.
